## Methods

### Multilocus Risk Score (MRS)
Compute risks from significant interactions
i = 1...n subjects
p SNPs
j = 1...k significant combinations
We apply the software... [@doi:10.1186/1471-2105-14-138] to obtain the significance level of each combination of SNPs.
allow for parallel computation
The maximum value of $k$ is $C^d_p$.
For each subject $i$, the $d$-way interaction risk score is calculated as
$$R_d(i) = \sum_{j = 1}^k \chi_j^2 \times HLO_j(X_{ij})$$
where $\chi_j^2$ is the test statistic of each multi-locus combination $j$ from a $\chi_j^2$ test with one degree of freedom for the simulated binary trait, $HLO_j$ is the $j^{th}$ re-coded HLO-matrix and $X_j$ is one of $k$ combination of SNPs.




### Simulated data
[Patryk...]

For each simulated and real-world dataset, after randomly splitting the entire data in two smaller sets (80% training and 20% holdout), we built the MRS model on training data to obtain the $\chi^2$ coefficients and calculated risk score for each individual in the holdout set.
We assess the performance of the MRS by comparing the area under the Receiving Operator Characteristic curve (auROC) with that of the standard GRS method where
