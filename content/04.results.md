### MRS outperforms standard PRS

![MRS produces improved auROC in the majority (335 green lines) of the 450 simulated datasets (each line represents a dataset). In many datasets, the original method performs poorly (auROC < 60%) while the new method yields auROC over 90%. This improvement in performance can be seen at the second peak (~50% auROC increase) in the density of the difference between two methods (right).](images/ori_vs_MRS_auROC_.svg){#fig:auroc_mrs_prs}

To assess whether this improvement in performance correlates with , in the following section, we untangled the two components in MRS and apply information theory to 

### Assess improvement in performance

As the amount of main effects increases (Fig. {@fig:improvements} left), MRS1 increasingly performs better than PRS, which is likely because encodings are inferred (top left).
Meanwhile, MRS2's accuracy remain similar to that of PRS (middle left).
On the other hand, when the amount of interaction effects increases (right), MRS1 performs mostly on par to PRS while MRS2
Combinging the gain from both MR1 and MRS2, MRS's performance progressively increases compared to the standard PRS.

![Combining 1-way (MRS1) and 2-way (MRS2) risk scores, MRS shows increasing outperformance to standard PRS as dataset contains more main and interaction effects](images/improvements_train_ms.svg){#fig:improvements}
