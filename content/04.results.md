### MRS outperforms standard PRS

![MRS produces improved auROC in the majority (335 green lines) of the 450 simulated datasets (each line represents a dataset). In many datasets, the original method performs poorly (auROC < 60%) while the new method yields auROC over 90%. This improvement in performance can be seen at the second peak (~50% auROC increase) in the density of the difference between two methods (right).](images/ori_vs_MRS_auROC_.svg)

![Combining 1-way (MRS1) and 2-way (MRS2) risk scores, MRS shows increasing outperformance to standard PRS as dataset contains more main effects and interaction effects](images/improvements_train_ms.svg)
As the amount of main effects increases, the MRS1 increasingly performs better than PRS, which is likely because encodings are inferred (top left).
Meanwhile, MRS2's performance  .
