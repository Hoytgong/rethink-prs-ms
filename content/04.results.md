### iPRS outperforms standard PRS

![MM12 produces improved auROC in the majority (335 green lines) of the 450 simulated datasets (each line represents a dataset). In many datasets, the original method performs poorly (auROC < 60%) while the new method yields auROC over 90%. This improvement in performance can be seen at the second peak (~50% auROC increase) in the density of the difference between two methods (right).](images/ori_vs_MM12D_auROC_.pdf)
