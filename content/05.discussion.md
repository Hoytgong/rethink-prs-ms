## Discussion
While PRS holds much promise for identifying individuals who may benefit from prioritized  preventions, one of its current limitation is the model simplicity [@doi:10.1038/s41576-018-0018-x].
To address one of the simplicity problems, in this study, we developed a new model that enables automatic genotype encodings and takes into account gene-gene interactions, thereby improved the generalizability of the risk scores.
To the best of our knowledge, MRS is the first risk score model that considers epistatic interactions [...]

We developed a method for 
We showed that the MRS method outperformed standard PRS in many of the simulated datasets, indicating that ...
We further examined the association between this improvement and the amount of two-way epistatic effect induced in the binary phenotypic outcome. 



We acknowledge a few limitations of the current study.
First, without real data...
Although we compensated the lack of real data with a diverse, unbiased set of simulated datasets, a future study analyzing will prove beneficial to quantify the new model's utility in practice.
Second, the computation expense...
small number of variants...
However, we hope this study will inspire others...
Finally, the risk score framework has received criticism, evaluation of PRS: not just in terms of sensitivity and specificity but also with respect to potential clinical efficacy.
